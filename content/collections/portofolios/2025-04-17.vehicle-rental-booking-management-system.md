    projects_problem_statement: 'Before the system was implemented, Batur Sari Rental managed bookings manually through chat and phone calls. This led to frequent double bookings, lack of centralized data, no analytics for business decisions, and inefficient payment handling. The client needed a full digital transformation to streamline operations, support online transactions, and gain actionable insights.'

    projects_design_approach: |-
      System design approach began with comprehensive research and design thinking, ensuring the business processes aligned with both user needs and organizational goals. Key components of the design include an Application Overview, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and organized workflows to streamline user journeys. The design approach was centered on modularity, user accessibility, and scalability:
      - **Monolithic System Architecture:** Monolithic architecture used for simplified deployment, cohesive data flow, and ease of maintenance in the early stages of development.
      - **Modular Feature Design:** Within the monolithic architecture, the system was broken down into clearly separated feature modules (student management, scheduling, performance tracking, payments, etc.) to maintain code clarity.
      - **User-Centered Design:** Developed intuitive UIs using Bootstrap and jQuery to ensure smooth usability for users, and admins.
      - **Separation of Concerns:** Adopted MVC architecture with service-repository layers for better code organization and testability.
      - **Security & Reliability:** Integrated Midtrans for secure payments and applied best practices for role based authentication and authorization.
      - **Analytics:** Embedded Google Analytics for user behavior tracking and system insights
      - **Performance Optimization:** Used FrankenPHP and Caddy for a fast, event-driven web server setup
