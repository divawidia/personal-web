    projects_problem_statement: "According to 2014 study conducted by the Ministry of Health, unhealthy diet patterns due to unfulfilled balanced nutrition are still a problem in Indonesia. Referring to the study, it is also known that the ratio of consumption of vegetable and animal protein is still not balanced, thus affecting the quality of people's food. Modern lifestyles often lead to poor eating habits, lack of physical activity, and minimal access to personalized health support. Many users struggle to track their calorie intake or get credible nutrition advice. Furthermore, there's a lack of localized, scalable API systems that support both calorie management and expert consultations within a single application backend."
