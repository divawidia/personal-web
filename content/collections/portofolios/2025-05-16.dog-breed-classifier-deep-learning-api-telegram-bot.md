    projects_overview: |-
      The Dog Breed Classifier is an AI-powered application that predicts the breed of a dog from an image and returns detailed information about the breed. It combines deep learning, API development, chatbot interaction, and cloud-native deployment into one cohesive project.

      At its core, the system uses a CNN-based image classifier built with TensorFlow and ResNet50 (transfer learning), trained on a dog breed dataset. The Flask-based REST API exposes endpoints for both classification and retrieving dog breed information stored in a MongoDB database. The Telegram bot, developed with Python, allows users to interact with the model by sending dog photos and receiving breed predictions and metadata instantly.

      The application is containerized with Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run for serverless hosting, Artifact Registry for container storage, and Cloud Build for CI/CD automation.

    projects_design_approach: |-
      The Dog Breed Classifier system was designed with a modular, scalable, and cloud-native architecture to ensure flexibility, performance, and maintainability. The key principles followed during development were:

      - **AI-First Solution:** Transfer Learning with ResNet50 was selected to balance accuracy and training efficiency. Leveraged a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fine-tuned on a labeled dog breed dataset to improve performance on unseen images.
      - **Separation of Concerns:** Each component—Telegram Bot, API, ML Model, and Database—was built as an independent service. Encouraged code reuse, simplified debugging, and made scaling specific parts (like the model or API) easier.
      - **API-Driven Architecture:** A RESTful Flask API acted as the central hub for image prediction and data retrieval. Enabled integration with multiple frontends, such as the Telegram bot and potential future mobile/web apps.
      - **User-Centric Bot Design:** The Telegram bot interface was designed to be minimal and intuitive: Users send a dog image > Bot returns the breed prediction with details like temperament and lifespan > Created a smooth experience with minimal learning curve for users.
      - **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Used Docker for environment consistency across development and production. Deployed via Google Cloud Run for scalability and auto-scaling based on usage demand. Integrated Google Cloud Build and Artifact Registry for a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.
      - **Database & Metadata:** Chose MongoDB for its flexibility in storing varied dog breed metadata. Enabled quick access and filtering of breed characteristics in future versions.
