    projects_problem_statement: "LPK Rhapsody Hospitality previously doesn't have website for their company profile, which limited their online presence and made it difficult for potential students and partners to discover their programs, achievements, and services. All information dissemination relied heavily on offline methods or social media, which lacked the professionalism and flexibility of a centralized digital platform. Additionally, the absence of a content management system meant any future updates would require technical involvement, creating inefficiencies in keeping information current. It's difficult for non-technical staff to update content regularly. Any updates had to go through a developer, causing delays and inefficiencies. The organization needed a self-service CMS with company profile site to improve online presence, marketing, agility in updating offerings, news, and announcements, while maintaining professional presentation and content consistency."

    projects_design_approach: |-
      My approach started by identifying the company's brand identity, services, programs, achievements, company profiles, and the most frequently updated content types (e.g., course details, news, banners). We mapped these into reusable content models and built a modular UI/UX based on simplicity and clarity. Key design steps included:
      - User research with content editors to define UX flows
      - Information architecture planning for SEO-friendly structure
      - Database schema planning for page types, media, and metadata
      - Admin UI wireframing with form validations and role access control
      - Used Laravel Blade templating to separate content logic and presentation
