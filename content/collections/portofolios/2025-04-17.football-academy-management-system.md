description: |-
  The Football Academy Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the operations of football academies. The system allows coaches, staff, and administrators to efficiently manage student data, track performance metrics, schedule trainings and matches, process payments, and deliver online learning materials. Developed using Laravel, Bootstrap, and jQuery, this platform aims to improve communication, performance monitoring, and academy management.

  This project was built with scalability in mind, allowing future expansion to support various sports academies such as basketball, futsal, swimming, and more. The system is planned to be launched as a SaaS (Software as a Service) product with subscription-based features.

    projects_problem_statement: 'Dreamfields football academy often rely on manual processes or fragmented tools for managing student data, schedules, and payments. This leads to inefficiencies, missed communications, and difficulties in tracking student progress. Additionally, there is a lack of centralized systems that support online learning and performance-based leaderboards, especially for growing academies looking to scale.'

    projects_design_approach: |-
      Our design process started with in-depth research and design thinking to align the platform with football academy workflows. We created detailed business process designs, including: Application Overview, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Database Design.
      The design approach was centered on modularity, user accessibility, and scalability:

      - Monolithic System Architecture: Chose a monolithic architecture for simplified deployment, cohesive data flow, and ease of maintenance in the early stages of development.
      - Modular Feature Design: Within the monolithic architecture, the system was broken down into clearly separated feature modules (student management, scheduling, performance tracking, payments, etc.) to maintain code clarity.
      - User-Centered Design: Developed intuitive UIs using Bootstrap and jQuery to ensure smooth usability for coaches, admins, and players.
      - Separation of Concerns: Adopted MVC architecture with service-repository layers for better code organization and testability.
      - Security & Reliability: Integrated Midtrans for secure payments and applied best practices for authentication and authorization.
