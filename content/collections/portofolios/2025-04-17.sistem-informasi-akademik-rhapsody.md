    projects_problem_statement: 'Before digitalization, LPK Rhapsody relied heavily on manual operations via spreadsheets and paper-based records for managing students, classes, and payments. This led to data inconsistency, high administrative workload, and lack of real-time insights into academic and financial performance. The institution needed a centralized digital solution to optimize operations, ensure data integrity, and enhance service delivery to students.'

      - Developed a monolithic Laravel-based web application to manage the academy’s end-to-end operations
      - Integrated a secure MySQL database hosted on Azure Database for MySQL for centralized data storage
      - Used Azure Blob Storage for storing student documents and learning materials
      - Deployed the backend on Azure Virtual Machine using Docker for containerized and scalable architecture
      - Leveraged FrankenPHP and Caddy for a high-performance web server setup to reduce latency and optimize server response
      - Implemented role-based access for administrators, instructors, and students

    projects_design_approach: |-
      The design process began with in-depth research into the academy's workflow, followed by stakeholder interviews and user journey mapping to fully understand daily administrative and educational processes. We applied design thinking principles to create:
      - A holistic system blueprint aligned with the academy’s goals
      - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to define roles and processes
      - A well-structured database schema tailored for academic records and transactions
      - Wireframes and UX prototypes to ensure intuitive navigation for all user types (admin, instructor, student)
      The system was built using a monolithic Laravel architecture to simplify deployment and maintenance, while maintaining flexibility and scalability for future features.
