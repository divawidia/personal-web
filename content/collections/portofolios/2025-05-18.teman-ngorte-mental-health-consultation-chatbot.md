    projects_problem_statement: |-
      According to Riskesdas 2018 data, over 19 million Indonesians aged 15 and above suffer from mental illness. Litbangkes reports nearly 2,000 suicide cases annually. Despite these alarming statistics, mental health resources remain scarce in Indonesia: there are only 48 mental hospitals (32 state-owned, 16 private), with 8 provinces lacking any, and only around 1,053 professional mental health workers nationwide.
      This shows a massive gap between the demand for mental health support and its availability. There is an urgent need for scalable, accessible mental health tools that can provide preliminary support and promote emotional well-being.

    explanations: |-
      The Teman Ngorte chatbot system is composed of two primary components: Frontend and Backend.
      **Frontend**
      The frontend is built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a clean user interface (UI) optimized for mental wellness interaction. This part of the application is deployed on Vercel, enabling seamless global access through the web. The frontend communicates with the backend through a RESTful JSON API, sending HTTP requests to retrieve chatbot responses and user data.
      **Backend**
      The backend is developed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to handle application logic, user authentication, and chatbot interactions. It provides RESTful API endpoints that are consumed by the frontend.
      **Chatbot Module**
      A key feature of the backend is the chatbot module, which uses a BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model implemented with TensorFlow. This model is trained on labeled mental health datasets to generate empathetic and contextually appropriate responses to user input.
      **Storage**
      For data persistence, the system uses a MySQL database, which is hosted on Railway, a cloud platform that simplifies database deployment and integration.
      **Deployment**
      The backend is containerized using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run, which allows for automatic scaling and serverless execution. This setup ensures reliability and scalability for handling real-time conversations and multiple concurrent users.
      **Communication Flow**
      - The frontend sends HTTP requests to the Flask backend.
      - Flask routes the requests to either: Web service logic (e.g., user authentication, chat logging), The BiLSTM-based chatbot module for generating responses
      - The backend returns results as JSON-formatted API responses to the frontend.
      - The frontend displays the chatbot response to the user in real time.
